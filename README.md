This repository contains the files where I worked on this final project with my group member Abdallah Ratib Hwishel and his gitlab link can be accessed here https://gitlab.cs.umd.edu/ahwishel. Our team name is Scientology.

The Jupyter Notebook file represents our final project mostly done without the last section so this can be accessed through the link and the index file represents our final project html default page.
